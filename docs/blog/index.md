# My Blog

Hello! Disclaimer: I’m no prodigy in the realms of what I scribble here, learning is a journey and I don’t think you ever stop off on that journey! Over the past few years my home lab has progressed quite drastically, from a basic ISP network with a single router and a home servers / containers running pihole to a full home lab network which is running, opnsense, a proxmox ve cluster running docker containers and other services and a k8s cluster deployed using kubespray. It has been developed from what I have learned working as a DevOps Engineer, stuff I’ve figured out along the way during the setup as well as stuff I have read from other people’s helpful blog posts.

The aim of this blog is to outline my current setup, to not only help myself remember how everything is configured, but also it might help someone else along their home lab setup journey too. Let’s dive in and see what quirky adventures we can uncover together! So here goes, happy home labbing!

# About me

As an energetic DevOps Engineer, I bring extensive technical proficiency and hands-on involvement across various systems and technologies in my current position—essentially, it's like having to be Swiss Army knife, but with more YAML and fewer sharp edges. My disciplined approach and self-reliance allow me to excel with minimal oversight, while my collaborative nature fosters seamless teamwork (and I even occasionally tolerate meetings that could’ve been emails).
