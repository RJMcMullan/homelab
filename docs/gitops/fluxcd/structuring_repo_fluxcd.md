# How to structure your repository
When structuring a FluxCD repository, the goal is to organize your Kubernetes and infrastructure manifests in a way that supports GitOps principles: having Git as the single source of truth, enabling automated, repeatable, and declarative deployments.

Here are some common ways of structuring a FluxCD repository:

### 1. Mono Repository (Monorepo)
In a mono repository, both applications and infrastructure components are stored in a single Git repository. This structure centralizes all the configurations for managing your cluster.

Example Structure:

```bash
├── apps/
│   ├── base/
│   └── production/
├── clusters/
│   ├── k8s-prod/
│   │   ├── infrastructure.yaml
│   │   ├── apps.yaml
│   └── flux-system/
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── base/
│   └── production/
└── .flux.yaml
```

- `apps/`: Stores your application configurations.
  - base/: Reusable base configurations for all environments.
  - production/: Environment-specific overlays for production.
- `clusters/k8s-prod/`: Contains Kustomizations that reference the GitRepository and paths for both apps/ and infrastructure/.
- `infrastructure/`: Contains infrastructure components (e.g., NGINX Ingress, Grafana).
  - base/: Common base configuration for all infrastructure components.
  - production/: Production-specific overlays to adjust resources and other settings.


**Advantages:**

Centralized management of both apps and infrastructure.
Simplifies versioning, as everything is managed in one repository.

**Disadvantages:**

Can grow large and complex as more components are added.
Can create longer commit histories that are harder to manage.

### 2. Multi-Repository (Polyrepo)
In a multi-repository structure, different Git repositories are used for various components, such as applications, infrastructure, and cluster configurations. Each repository handles a specific aspect of the cluster, and FluxCD pulls from each.

Example:

```bash

app-repo/
└── apps/
    ├── base/
    └── production/

infra-repo/
└── infrastructure/
    ├── base/
    └── production/

clusters-repo/
└── clusters/
    ├── k8s-prod/
    └── flux-system/
```
- `app-repo/`: Contains only application configurations.
- `infra-repo/`: Contains infrastructure components.
- `clusters-repo/`: Contains cluster configurations and FluxCD bootstrap components.

**Advantages:**

Separation of concerns: app, infra, and cluster management are handled independently.
Teams can work on their own repositories without affecting others.

**Disadvantages:**

Complex management: requires handling multiple repositories, coordinating changes, and ensuring compatibility.
Need for automation tools to handle cross-repo synchronization.

### 3. Environment-Based Structure
Each environment (e.g., dev, staging, prod) has its own directory or repository. This structure helps manage separate environments with isolated configurations.

Example:

```bash
flux-repo/
├── dev/
│   ├── apps/
│   └── infrastructure/
├── staging/
│   ├── apps/
│   └── infrastructure/
└── prod/
    ├── apps/
    └── infrastructure/
```
- `dev/`, `staging/`, `prod/`: Each environment is separated with its own applications and infrastructure configurations.

**Advantages:**

Isolates environments completely, preventing accidental deployment of configurations across environments.
Clear separation of deployment environments and their respective states.

**Disadvantages:**

Potential duplication of configurations if the same applications or infrastructure components are used across environments.
More work to maintain consistency across environments.

### 4. Component-Based Structure
This structure organizes the repository based on individual components like ingress, monitoring, storage, etc., with each component having its own folder.

Example:

```bash
Copy code
flux-repo/
├── ingress/
│   ├── base/
│   └── overlays/
├── monitoring/
│   ├── base/
│   └── overlays/
├── storage/
│   ├── base/
│   └── overlays/
└── .flux.yaml
```
- `ingress/`: Contains configurations for NGINX Ingress, cert-manager, etc.
- `monitoring/`: Contains configurations for Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, etc.
- `storage/`: Contains configurations for Longhorn, NFS Subdir External Provisioner, etc.

**Advantages:**

Allows modular management of different components.
Each component can evolve independently with its own base and overlay structures.

**Disadvantages:**

Requires careful management of dependencies between components.
Can become complex if components interact heavily.

### 5. Tenant-Based Structure (Multi-Tenancy)
This structure is used for managing multiple tenants within a single cluster. Each tenant’s applications and configurations are isolated in their own directory or repository.

Example:

```bash
  
flux-repo/
├── tenants/
│   ├── tenant-a/
│   │   ├── apps/
│   │   └── infrastructure/
│   └── tenant-b/
│       ├── apps/
│       └── infrastructure/
└── clusters/
    └── k8s-prod/
```
- `tenants/`: Each tenant has its own isolated directory with applications and infrastructure configurations.
- `clusters/`: The cluster-level configurations that apply to the overall cluster.

**Advantages:**

Provides strong isolation between tenants.
Supports multi-tenancy use cases where different teams or customers need separate environments.

**Disadvantages:**

Can lead to duplication of configuration files across tenants.
More work required to maintain consistency across tenants.

### 6. Single Source of Truth (Environment Branches)
In this structure, each environment (dev, staging, prod) is represented by different Git branches. FluxCD monitors these branches and applies the configurations accordingly.

Example:

- `main`: Represents production.
- `staging`: Represents the staging environment.
- `dev`: Represents the development environment.

FluxCD is configured to monitor the correct branch based on the environment.

**Advantages:**

Simple and easy to understand branching strategy.
Easy rollback by switching branches.

**Disadvantages:**

Can cause branching conflicts if not carefully managed.
Merge conflicts might arise when promoting changes from dev to staging or production.

### Choosing the Right Structure
- Monorepo is suitable for smaller teams or projects that benefit from centralized management.
- Polyrepo is better for larger organizations with separate teams managing different parts of the system.
- Environment-based structures help when environments need to be strongly isolated from each other.
- Component-based structures are ideal when managing a complex system where components evolve independently.
- Tenant-based structures are good for multi-tenant systems where each tenant requires isolated configurations.
